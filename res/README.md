Results folder

This folder contains CSV summaries generated by the aggregation scripts.

Files
- summary.csv: seed-wise rows for all runs (run, dataset, method, seed, acc, nll, ece, brier).
- summary_ci.csv: aggregated means, std and CI95 by (dataset, method).
- seedwise.csv: copy of summary.csv.
- pair_<dataset>.csv: paired CE vs PLR metrics for common seeds.
- mnist_plr_vs_ce.csv / mnist_plr_vs_ce_agg.csv: explicit MNIST PLR vs CE rows and aggregation.
- mnist_ece_group.csv: group summary of ECE for CE, plr_0.6, plr_0.7.

How to reproduce
1. Run experiments to create `runs/<run_dir>/config.json` and metrics files.
2. From repo root run: `python scripts/aggregate_and_plots.py`.

Metric definitions
- acc: accuracy on test/val set.
- nll: mean cross-entropy (negative log-likelihood).
- ece: expected calibration error (lower is better).
- brier: Brier score.

If you need plots instead of CSVs, use the scripts in `scripts/` to regenerate PNGs.
